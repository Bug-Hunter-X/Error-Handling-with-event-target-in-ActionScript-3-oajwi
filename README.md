This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error related to type checking when using event listeners. The `bug.as` file shows code that attempts to access properties of an event's target object without checking its type.  The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version that uses type checking to prevent runtime errors.  The bug occurs when the `event.target` object is not of the expected type. This is a frequent issue in event-driven programming.
